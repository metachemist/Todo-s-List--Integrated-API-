 üéØ **Set Due Dates:** Assign a due date to each task to keep track of deadlines.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular Framework:** The app is built using Angular for component-based development and efficient user interface handling.

- **TypeScript:** For writing clean, readable, and scalable code.

- **HTML & CSS:**  For designing the layout and user interface of the application

## Future Improvements
- **Priority Levels:** Ability to assign priority levels to tasks (high, medium, low).
- **Search and Filter:** Search for tasks and filter by status (completed, pending).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
